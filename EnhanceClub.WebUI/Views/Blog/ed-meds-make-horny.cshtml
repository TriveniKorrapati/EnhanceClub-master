                                    One of most common questions guys have about taking medications for sex is “what else will it do?” What they’re really asking is if taking erectile dysfunction medication will make you horny? The simple answer is no. But, and it is a big but, it also depends mostly on how you think and feel. Psychological barriers are some of the most common factors in sexual dysfunction.
                                </p>

The drugs help increase blood flow to your penis – that’s what makes your penis stiff. But it does not raise your sex drive. Only you know what fires your freaky engine and that can’t be prescribed in a pill. However…

                                    While ED meds wont technically make you horny, one of the key issues a lot of men point to when experiencing issues with sexual performance is confidence. If a man is taking an ED med, he knows that no matter what fun is suddenly placed in front of him, he’ll have the confidence to be good to go. That is a huge factor for men, confidence. No one wants to disappoint their partner in bed. Or worry about their inability to perform up to everybody’s expectations – including their own.

                                    Sexual enhancements help give confidence to not only feel able to perform sexually if desired but be able to do it well when the time comes to cum. (*Disclaimer: it is up to you to work on your own techniques. Partners always appreciate the effort of learning new skills!) Various medications you can take will have different effects, including how long they’ll last. But none are designed to increase your libido. That’s up to you.

                                    If you are having trouble finding the right headspace to get your small head in a warm space, you’re not alone. There are a lot of reasons why emotional stability and self-awareness are integral to fueling your sex drive. If we don’t want to have sex or think we’re not desirable enough for sex, getting horny can be a challenge. The brain sometimes puts barriers up in places when we least expect it. But there are lots of ways to get simple help and breakdown those roadblocks that are leaving you cockblocked.

                                    Feeling sexually aroused is about the pleasure centers of your brain firing off at the right times based on the stimulation it receives – either consciously or unconsciously. We’re often triggered by chemical reactions we aren’t even aware of.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/treating-hsdd/low-libido-and-depression">Depression can lead to a lower libido</a>. The body wants to enjoy the pleasures of life because your brain remembers how good it feels. The solution can be to make sure stimulating and rewarding your sexual desires isn't pushed aside because of the other issues you deal with throughout your daily life.

                                    Most men will experience performance related issues as they get older. It’s just a fact. A lot of the time, if it’s not related to an underlying health condition, it really comes down to what’s going on in their head, not between their legs. So, while ED meds help set the stage so you’re ready to have sex, it’s up to you to find the will, not just the way, to keep your sex drive in top gear. Everything in life needs the right conditions to grow. If you want to go from a flaccid flapper into being cocked-and-loaded, make sure to check in with yourself about what might be holding you back. You’re certainly not the first, nor the last, and you’re definitely not alone.
